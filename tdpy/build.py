"""The network this project builds.

This is the file to edit. It is the only module that reaches into TouchDesigner,
which keeps the rest of the package readable - and testable - outside it.

Phase 1 builds the playlist and nothing else: a Table DAT holding one row per
video file in `media/`, measured. No playback yet - that is Phase 2. The Phase 0
placeholder network (a noise TOP proving the .toe could run Python off disk) is
gone, having done its job.

Any import of `td` or of a third-party package belongs inside build(), not at
module scope: this module is imported early enough that the side-loaded
environment may not be ready yet. Deferring the import until the function
actually runs is what Derivative means by initializing lazily - and it keeps
this file importable outside TouchDesigner, where neither exists.
"""

#: Where the network is built. TouchDesigner opens a project showing the inside
#: of /project1, not the true root, so building at "/" puts the network beside
#: that container rather than in it - present, addressable by path, and invisible
#: where you are actually looking. Falls back to the root if /project1 is absent.
BUILD_PARENT = "/project1"

#: Name of the container the build owns. Everything it makes lives in here.
BUILD_ROOT = "generated"

#: Name of the Table DAT holding the playlist. Phase 2 onwards reads the clips
#: out of here, so it is named once and referred to rather than spelled again.
